        <h3> Arbitration </h3>
        <p>In the event the parties are not able to resolve any dispute between them arising out of or concerning
          these Terms and Conditions, or any provisions hereof, whether in contract, tort, or otherwise at law or in
          equity for damages or any other relief, then such dispute shall be resolved only by final and binding
          arbitration pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act, conducted by a single neutral arbitrator and
          administered by the American Arbitration Association, or a similar arbitration service selected by the
          parties, in a location mutually agreed upon by the parties. The arbitrator's award shall be final, and
          judgment may be entered upon it in any court having jurisdiction. In the event that any legal or equitable
          action, proceeding or arbitration arises out of or concerns these Terms and Conditions, the prevailing party
          shall be entitled to recover its costs and reasonable attorney's fees. The parties agree to arbitrate all
          disputes and claims in regards to these Terms and Conditions or any disputes arising as a result of these
          Terms and Conditions, whether directly or indirectly, including Tort claims that are a result of these Terms
          and Conditions. The parties agree that the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and
          enforcement of this provision. The entire dispute, including the scope and enforceability of this

          termination of these Terms and Conditions. </p>
        <h3> Class Action Waiver </h3>
        <p>Any arbitration under these Terms and Conditions will take place on an individual basis; class
          arbitrations and class/representative/collective actions are not permitted. THE PARTIES AGREE THAT A PARTY
          MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN EACH'S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS
          MEMBER IN ANY PUTATIVE CLASS, COLLECTIVE AND/ OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, SUCH AS IN THE FORM OF A PRIVATE
          ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION AGAINST THE OTHER. Further, unless both you and Hunters Social agree otherwise, the
          arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of
          a representative or class proceeding. </p>
